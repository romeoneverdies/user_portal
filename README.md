# user_portal
Local User portal for your home network. (use at your own risk)

This portal allows for user to change / reset their password in a ldap server 
plus it generates certificates with the ca_tool script ( see my other repositories...)

go look in do.php ... to install and personalise to your network. the "portal.secret" file is there so the system can interact with ldap...
this will encrypt the password after you uncomment the line were it is said so. if you do it more than once you might have issues...
